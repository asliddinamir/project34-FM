      <h2 class="card_title">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
      <p class="card_description">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make
        a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
        course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
        grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
        Software Engineer at a VR startup. ” </p>
